FOTOGRID is an open photo album app. Visitors can see all the pictures and only logged-in users can upload photos.
FOTOGRID is built on React.js (front-end) and uses google cloud service (Firebase) as back-end.

Thanks to React framework, the site renders instantly when any changes is made (new uploaded photos, login log out process).
All uploaded pictures show the avatar of uploader,
Visual effects are done by CSS markups and a React.js library Framer Motion .

Firebase takes care of backend process on the cloud: Photo storage, database, authentication thanks to its superb speed and ease of integration.
Notice that only png or jpeg files are supported.
